**Demo Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Presenter:** Developer  
**Demo Setup:** Slack workspace with bot, sample keywords ready

---

## [0:00 - 0:30] Introduction (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon! I'm excited to demonstrate the SlackBot Content Creation Assistant that I built from scratch. This AI-powered tool helps content teams automate their keyword research and content planning process, reducing what used to take days down to minutes.

Today I'll walk you through the architecture, key components, processing pipeline, external integrations, and show a live demo of all features working in Slack."

## [0:30 - 2:30] Overall Architecture (2 minutes)

"Let me start with the high-level architecture. The application follows a modular, service-oriented design:

**Core Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Slack (no traditional UI - everything happens in Slack)
- **Backend:** Python 3.11 with Flask for health checks
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
- **Cache:** Redis (Upstash) for session management and performance
- **Deployment:** Docker container on Render.com

**Service Layers:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Slack Client  │ ← User interacts here
└────────┬────────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │ Handlers│ ← Command/Event processing
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌────▼────┐
    │ Pipeline│ ← Main orchestration
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ├───┬───┬───┤
    │   │   │   │
AI   Data Ext. Processing ← Modular services
Services Services Services
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Modular services for maintainability
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking Slack
- External APIs for AI and search capabilities
- Containerization for easy deployment"

## [2:30 - 4:30] Main Important Scripts & Components (2 minutes)

"Now let me highlight the most critical scripts and components:

**Entry Point - `app/main.py`:**
```python
# Initializes Slack Bolt app, health server, and all handlers
app = App(token=SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, signing_secret=SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET)
# Registers command handlers and event handlers
# Starts health check server on port 3000
```

**Command Handlers - `app/handlers/command_handlers.py`:**
- `/process_keywords` - Initiates the entire workflow
- `/history` - Shows past batches with interactive buttons
- `/regenerate` - Regenerates outlines for existing batches
- `/set_email` - Configures email delivery
- `/export` - Bonus feature for Notion/Google Sheets export

**Processing Pipeline - `app/services/processing/pipeline.py`:**
- Orchestrates the complete workflow: clean → cluster → research → generate → report
- Handles async processing with threading
- Comprehensive error handling and progress updates

**AI Services:**
- `embedding_generator.py` - Creates vector embeddings using sentence-transformers
- `outline_generator.py` - Uses Groq LLM to create detailed content outlines
- `idea_generator.py` - Generates unique post ideas with angles and audiences

**Data Services:**
- `database.py` - All Supabase operations (users, batches, clusters, reports)
- `cache.py` - Redis operations for embeddings and session state

**External Integrations:**
- `web_search.py` - Brave Search API integration
- `content_scraper.py` - BeautifulSoup-based web scraping
- `email_service.py` - SendGrid integration for PDF delivery"

## [4:30 - 6:30] Pipeline Explanation (2 minutes)

"The processing pipeline is the heart of the application. Let me walk through how it works:

**Step 1: Input Processing (30 seconds)**
- User uploads CSV or pastes keywords
- `KeywordParser` handles both formats
- Basic validation and acknowledgment

**Step 2: Keyword Cleaning (20 seconds)**
- `KeywordCleaner` removes duplicates, normalizes text
- Converts to lowercase, removes special chars
- Returns statistics: '150 keywords → 142 unique'

**Step 3: Semantic Clustering (1 minute)**
- `EmbeddingGenerator` creates vector embeddings using sentence-transformers
- `KeywordClusterer` applies K-means clustering with silhouette score optimization
- Generates descriptive names like 'Running Shoes', 'Yoga Equipment'
- Handles 3-10 clusters based on data

**Step 4: Content Research (1 minute)**
- `WebSearchService` queries Brave Search API for top results
- `ContentScraper` extracts H1, H2, H3 headings from top 3-5 pages
- Identifies common topics across competitive content
- Polite scraping with rate limiting

**Step 5: AI Content Generation (1 minute)**
- `OutlineGenerator` uses Groq LLM to create structured outlines
- Analyzes common topics to build comprehensive content structures
- `IdeaGenerator` creates unique post ideas with angles and audiences
- Each cluster gets one compelling content idea

**Step 6: Report Generation & Delivery (30 seconds)**
- `ReportGenerator` creates professional PDF with all results
- Uploads to Slack channel
- Optional email delivery via SendGrid
- Updates database with completion status

**Error Handling Throughout:**
- Each step has try/catch blocks
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- User gets clear error messages with next steps
- Comprehensive logging for debugging"

## [6:30 - 7:30] External Services Explanation (1 minute)

"The application integrates with several external services, all using free tiers:

**AI & ML Services:**
- **Groq API** (Llama 3.1-8B): Content generation, generous free tier
- **Sentence Transformers**: Local ML model for embeddings (no API costs)

**Search & Content:**
- **Brave Search API**: 2000 queries/month free, reliable search results
- **BeautifulSoup**: Local HTML parsing (free, no API)

**Data & Infrastructure:**
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with vector extensions, generous free tier
- **Upstash Redis**: Managed Redis, 10,000 requests/month free
- **SendGrid**: Email delivery, 100 emails/day free

**Deployment & Hosting:**
- **Render.com**: Docker hosting, 750 hours/month free
- **GitHub**: Version control and auto-deployment

**Cost Optimization:**
- All services use free tiers effectively
- Caching reduces API calls
- Efficient processing minimizes compute costs"

## [7:30 - 8:30] SlackBot Implementation (1 minute)

"The Slack integration is built using the Slack Bolt framework:

**Bot Setup:**
- Slack app with Bot Token and Signing Secret
- Socket Mode for real-time event handling
- Permissions: chat:write, files:write, channels:history, etc.

**Event Handling:**
- **Slash Commands**: `/process_keywords`, `/history`, `/regenerate`, etc.
- **File Uploads**: Automatic CSV processing when files are shared
- **Message Events**: Keyword parsing from text input
- **App Mentions**: General help and status

**State Management:**
- Redis stores user state during multi-step workflows
- Prevents concurrent processing conflicts
- Session timeout handling

**Message Formatting:**
- Slack Block Kit for rich, interactive messages
- Progress updates during long operations
- Interactive buttons for batch management
- Mobile-optimized layouts

**Real-time Updates:**
- Progress messages: 'Cleaning keywords...', 'Creating clusters...'
- Error notifications with actionable guidance
- Completion notifications with file links"
