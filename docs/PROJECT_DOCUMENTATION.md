## Core Features Implementation

### 1. Keyword Processing Pipeline

The keyword processing pipeline is the heart of the application, implementing a sophisticated workflow:

#### Input Processing
- **CSV Upload**: Parse CSV files with keyword columns using pandas
- **Text Input**: Handle comma or newline-separated keywords
- **Validation**: Ensure minimum keyword count and format validation
- **Slack Integration**: Automatic file download and processing

#### Keyword Cleaning & Normalization
- Remove duplicates (case-insensitive)
- Trim whitespace and special characters
- Convert to lowercase for consistency
- Filter empty strings and invalid entries
- Provide statistics on cleaning results

#### Semantic Clustering
- Generate vector embeddings using sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Apply K-means clustering with silhouette score optimization
- Create descriptive cluster names from common keywords
- Handle edge cases (few keywords, outliers)
- Cache embeddings in Redis for performance

#### Content Research
- Search top-ranking content using Brave Search API
- Scrape web pages for headings (H1, H2, H3) using BeautifulSoup
- Extract common topics across multiple pages
- Handle rate limiting and error recovery
- Respect robots.txt and implement polite scraping
